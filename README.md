# Adaptive Network Diagnostic System

This project is a **Final Year Project (FYP)** that develops an adaptive network diagnostic system combining **rule-based analysis** and an **enhanced autoencoder** to detect and classify anomalies in clustered LAN environments. The system is designed for institutional networks, providing **automated, accurate, and user-friendly diagnostics** without requiring deep technical expertise.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- **Hybrid Diagnostic Engine**
  - Rule-based engine with dynamic threshold management  
  - TensorFlow-based enhanced autoencoder for anomaly detection  
  - Decision fusion mechanism (70% rule-based, 30% ML)  

- **Agent Module**
  - Collects system metrics, faults, processes, and ML insights  
  - Runs IP diagnostics (DHCP, DNS, connectivity checks)  
  - Sends data using **multi-protocol fallback**:  
    1. HTTP (primary)  
    2. UDP Broadcast (fallback)  
    3. Layer 2 Ethernet (last resort)  

- **Server Module**
  - Flask-based central dashboard for monitoring  
  - SQLite database to store agents, metrics, faults, ML insights, IP diagnostics, and events  
  - Handles agent communication via HTTP, UDP, and Layer 2 Ethernet  
  - Real-time dashboards with Plotly visualizations  
  - Event logging and troubleshooting insights

## ðŸ”¹ Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## ðŸ”¹ Usage
python server.py
Runs on http://localhost:8080

python agent.py
Local dashboard available at http://localhost:5000

---

## ðŸ”¹ Configuration
Settings are stored in agent_config.ini:
[AGENT]
enabled = true
server_url = http://localhost:8080
send_interval = 30
enable_layer2 = true
broadcast_port = 9999

[DATA]
send_metrics = true
send_faults = true
send_processes = true
send_ml_insights = true
send_ip_diagnostics = true

---

##ðŸ”¹ Example Workflow
1. Agent collects system metrics and diagnostics.
2. Sends data to server via HTTP â†’ if it fails, falls back to UDP â†’ if that fails, uses Layer 2.
3. Server aggregates data and applies hybrid diagnostic logic.
4. Results and alerts are stored in SQLite and displayed on the dashboard.
